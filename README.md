# Credit Default Prediction and Stock Market Risk Analysis
## Course: Finance and Risk Analytics

### Overview
This project is divided into two main parts:
- **Part A: Credit Default Prediction** aims to predict the likelihood of companies defaulting on their debt obligations using financial data and machine learning models.
- **Part B: Stock Market Risk Analysis** focuses on assessing the volatility and performance of Indian stocks, providing valuable insights into market risk for investors.

These analyses serve as essential tools for financial institutions, investors, and other stakeholders to make data-driven decisions related to creditworthiness and investment strategies.

## Project Objectives
- **Part A**: Develop a predictive model to assess company credit default risk using historical financial data.
- **Part B**: Evaluate the volatility and returns of a portfolio of stocks to understand market risks and optimize investment strategies.

## Part A: Credit Default Prediction
### Problem Statement
Predict a company's ability to meet debt obligations based on financial metrics, using machine learning models to provide actionable insights for risk management.

### Approach
1. **Data Understanding & Preparation**:
   - Loaded and explored financial data for various companies.
   - Preprocessed data by handling missing values and treating outliers.
2. **Modeling**:
   - Built and evaluated predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
   - Enhanced performance through feature engineering, multicollinearity treatment, and hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Insights**:
   - Key features influencing credit default risk include retained earnings, net profit ratios, and total debt.
   - Developed risk mitigation strategies based on predictive outputs.

## Part B: Stock Market Risk Analysis
### Problem Statement
Assess the risk and performance of a portfolio of Indian stocks using historical price data, focusing on volatility and returns to inform investment strategies.

### Approach
1. **Data Exploration & Preparation**:
   - Analyzed weekly stock price data for five Indian companies.
   - Cleaned and prepared data for statistical analysis.
2. **Risk and Return Analysis**:
   - Computed historical returns and analyzed mean and standard deviation for each stock.
   - Visualized stock trends and assessed risk-reward trade-offs.
3. **Insights**:
   - Stocks with higher volatility posed greater risks; specific stocks demonstrated consistent performance.
   - Balanced investment strategies are recommended based on risk tolerance.
